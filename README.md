# React State Update Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React where state updates don't immediately reflect in the UI, causing inconsistencies. The problem arises when the updated state is used indirectly, for example, in a calculation or conditional rendering within the component.  The solution explains how to properly address this using useEffect for asynchronous operations or ensuring that the JSX uses the updated state to force a re-render.

## Problem Description
The `MyComponent` attempts to increment a state variable, `count`, however, this update might not immediately update the UI.  This can lead to situations where the displayed count is stale or incorrect, especially when the updated `count` isn't directly displayed in the JSX but used within other calculations or functions within the component. 

## Solution
The solution demonstrates techniques to guarantee that UI updates reflect the latest state. This involves directly using the updated state in the JSX or using techniques such as `useEffect` for asynchronous updates and to guarantee re-renders when needed.
